Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
=========================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The submission files are: 
1) a tidy data set 
2) a link to the Github repository with script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work  performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. A README.md is also included in the repository with the scripts. This repository explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
